<h2>📝 Forked Repository and Additional Features</h2>

<p>This project was originally forked from <a href="https://github.com/adrianhajdin/aora" target="_blank">JavaScript Mastery</a> and has been extended with the following additional features:</p>

## Enhancements

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bookmark Tab:</strong> Added functionality for users to save videos directly within the app. Each video now contains a `bookmarks` array that stores the user IDs of users who have saved/bookmarked it, allowing for easy access to saved content.</li>
  <li><strong>Appwrite Database Updates:</strong> Enhanced video attributes to include a `bookmarks` field for storing user IDs, facilitating personalized bookmarking capabilities.</li>
